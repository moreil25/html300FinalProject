HTML 300 Final Project

This final project showcases a variety of skills I have learned over the course of Module 3, from preprocessors to frameworks to APIs.

I will modify and migrate previous projects to build a Nuxt app and deploy a four page site using Netlify. My site will include an API, UI interaction, and use components I have created.

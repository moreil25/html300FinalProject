HTML 300 Final Project

This final project showcases a variety of skills I have learned over the course of Module 3, from preprocessors to frameworks to APIs.

I will modify and migrate previous projects to build a Nuxt app and deploy a four page site using Netlify. My site will include an API, UI interaction, and use components I have created.

SEO and analytics are written behind the scenes to boost marketing and reach, both organic and paid; as a dev, it helps to understand this aspect of marketing to create a product that performs well. The use of good site architecture, like using one H1 tag per page, boosts the web site's Google ranking. Analytics show how consumers interact with your site, and can offer a variety of metrics by which you can judge your business's success on the web. Social media metadata can be added to your site to control how it looks when shared and to be discoverable by social media channels.

IMPLEMENTING SEO ON THIS PROJECT
Ideally, I have already built a strong foundation on which my SEO will already be performing. I have used good H1-H6 tags to provide important infomation. Links to and out of my site are legitimate and serve a purpose. I think to really drive home the success of my website, I would include Twitter meta tag controls at the very least, though if it were a product for a client I would use as many social channels as they have available. Personally, I tend to steer away from Facebook overall, but especially in this case because I view Twitter as a better self-promotion tool than Facebook.

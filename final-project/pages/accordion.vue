In addition to raising attendance at these events from 30 people to 45 or more people, I worked with soldiers to create specific events geared toward them. Drawing on my past profesisonal experience, I mapped and developed a 45 minute walking tour of downtown Augusta, GA, that highlighted local art, local businesses, and historic locations. The primary goal of developing this resource was to help bring fellowship and a sense of belonging to military spouses. I manage an inventory of merchandise used to raise funds for annual reunion events, and have used Weebly to launch an eCommerce store to accomodate a larger audience.',

    <p class="lead">I come from a blended professional background in community engagement, marketing, and event planning. My educational background began in communications and journalism, where I began as a beat reporter and worked up to a section editor. During that time, I started to gain marketing experience at a small National Historic landmark. As I emerged from these positions, I learned early in my professional beginnings two important things: one, that I would be willing to do what it takes as a team member to create the content we needed (e.g. dress up in historic clothing in the summer in order to create original content for marketing materials), and two, how much I prefer the use of an Oxford comma over the traditional journalistic AP style.  I have shifted focus to continue to grow professionally by diving headfirst into the technology sector. I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Front-End Web Development online at the University of Washington. This program plays to my strengths, continuing to hone my attention to detail; one misplaced punctuation mark and a website can literally grind to a halt. Though it is a challenging pursuit, it is pushing me to grow professionally, inspiring me to rethink how I learn, and showing me beauty in a place that I previously thought was limited to logic.  </p>

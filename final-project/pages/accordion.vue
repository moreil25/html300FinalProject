I was the main organizer of several events that required marketing to a small, specific target audience to maximize attendance. In addition to raising attendance at these events from 30 people to 45 or more people, I worked with soldiers to create specific events geared toward them. Drawing on my past profesisonal experience, I mapped and developed a 45 minute walking tour of downtown Augusta, GA, that highlighted local art, local businesses, and historic locations. The primary goal of developing this resource was to help bring fellowship and a sense of belonging to military spouses.'
